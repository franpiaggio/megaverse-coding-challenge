# Crossmint coding challenge.

[Crossmint Documentation](https://challenge.crossmint.io/documentation)

# Approach

- I focused on solving the problem using Javascript without relying heavily on any frameworks or libraries.
- I developed some scripts that allowed me to interact with the grid quickly and easily to better understand how it works.
- I ultimately did not integrate any frontend technology, but set up a simple server using Express to run the scripts through some endpoints.

# Time Frame

It took me about four hours to complete this challenge.

- Further Improvements
  One issue I encountered during the challenge was receiving "Too many requests" error messages. To work around this issue, I added a delay between each request. If there is a better solution to this problem, I was not able to find it quickly and had to look for it in the documentation.

- Ideally, I would have liked to edit the grid using more extensive parameters, but given the time, I believe I made the most of what I had.

# Acknowledgments

I would like to thank for providing me with this interesting challenge. Additionally, I appreciate the opportunity to have been able to work on the challenge directly.
